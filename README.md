# Excel Exctraction for Find&Replace of Word Documents

The main goal of the code is to be able to extract from columns of an excel spreadsheet in order to replace text from pre-prepared standardised documents. This eliminates repetitive and meaningless work that bogs down many organisations throughout the globe.

The latest version has been re-worked to reduce the lines of code. All functionalites for same font/size/shape/colouring/highlighting remain intact.

## How to Use:

To run this code you will need the following:

```bash
  Jupyter Notebooks or Visual Studio Code
```

Step 1:
```bash
  Edit the variables indicated in the top section of the code to your desired files.
  i.e what is your Excel file name, what is your word file name etc.
```
Step 2:
```bash
  Run the code by pressing Shift+Enter or whichever is key-binded to run.
```
